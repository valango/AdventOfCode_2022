# Advent Of Code '2022

My [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com) adventures.<br />

Right in time I had no time ðŸ˜„, so I came back to this 11 months later.

## Diary

* `Day 01` **Calorie Counting**: simple summing and sorting -- spent most of the time trying to remember how to use my fancy runner.
* `Day 02` **Rock Paper Scissors**: simple game strategy modeling.
* `Day 03` **Rucksack Reorganization**: simple summing and sorting.
* `Day 04` **Camp Cleanup**: simple number sets operations.
* `Day 05` **Supply Stacks**: simple stacks manipulations.
* `Day 06` **Tuning Trouble**: simple numeric sequences analyse.
* `Day 07` **No Space Left On Device**: simple filesystem tree emulation.
* `Day 08` **Treetop Tree House**: simple 3D terrain emulation.
* `Day 09.1` **Rope Bridge**: kinda Turtle Graphics emulation. Puzzle #1: 51 min and _answer too low_. In 5 min the cause was found: input parsing error.
* `Day 09.2` Did not understand the description first; the wasted crazy amount of time because of wrong <length> argument value.<br>
To figure out what goes wrong, I had to write a dedicated renderer!
* `Day 10` **Cathode-Ray Tube**: #1 was super-simple; #2 involved reading of lengthy explanations.
* `Day 11` **Monkey in the Middle**:
   - #1 was simple computation based on quite wordy and hard to perceive explanation.
   - #2 previous brute force solution failed w arithmetic overflow; it took some arithmetic analysis to find proper solution. ðŸ’¥ Pretty cool!
* `Day 12` ** Hill Climbing Algorithm**:
   - #1 it appears that the input data is invalid: comparing `day12.out.txt` w input data reveals there is no adjacendt `p` for existing `q`!

The puzzle #2 time is often shorter, because the bulk of computations often happens during the #1 already.
